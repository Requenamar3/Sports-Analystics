**Sports analytics** exercise based on *Moneyball*â€”the story of how the Oakland Aâ€™s used data to build a winning baseball team on a tight budget. Let's break this down in simple terms and explain the **purpose** of each code section from Videos 2 and 3.


## ðŸŽ¯ **Overall Purpose of the Exercise**

This project is teaching you how to:

1. **Use historical baseball data** to understand what actually contributes to winning games.
2. **Build a data-driven strategy** to pick players who are undervalued but effective.
3. **Apply linear regression** to figure out what statistics (like OBP or SLG) truly matter in predicting success (runs scored, runs allowed, and wins).

This mirrors what the Oakland Aâ€™s did in real life: **use statistics to find hidden value** in players that big-budget teams ignored.
